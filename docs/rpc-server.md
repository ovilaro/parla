# Delta Chat RPC Server Packaging

Parla talks to `deltachat-rpc-server` over JSON-RPC on stdin/stdout. The
server is provided by the Chatmail/Delta Chat core project:

- Source: https://github.com/chatmail/core/tree/main/deltachat-rpc-server
- Releases: https://github.com/chatmail/core/releases
- PyPI binary wheels: https://pypi.org/project/deltachat-rpc-server/
- JSON-RPC install docs: https://py.delta.chat/jsonrpc/install.html

The upstream install options are:

- Install the Python wheel with `pip install deltachat-rpc-server`.
- Build from source with
  `cargo install --git https://github.com/chatmail/core/ deltachat-rpc-server`.
- Download a release asset such as `deltachat-rpc-server-x86_64-linux`,
  rename it to `deltachat-rpc-server`, make it executable, and put it in
  `PATH`.

For the end-to-end onboarding contract (one-click setup, the Parla-managed
download fallback, and how to package Parla so it never self-downloads), see
[`onboard.md`](onboard.md).

## Runtime Resolution

Parla's default `Auto` mode does not scan Delta Chat Desktop internals. It
uses, in order:

- `PARLA_RPC_SERVER`, if set and executable.
- A server installed next to Parla or under the same prefix, for example
  `/app/bin/deltachat-rpc-server`, `/usr/libexec/parla/deltachat-rpc-server`,
  or `/usr/lib/parla/deltachat-rpc-server`.
- `deltachat-rpc-server` from `PATH`.
- User installs in `~/.local/bin` or `~/.cargo/bin`.

Delta Chat Desktop's bundled server is still available from Settings as an
explicit compatibility mode. That mode also reuses Delta Chat Desktop's account
store.

Parla also stores accounts in its own XDG data directory by default. Desktop's
account store can still conflict with Desktop if both applications try to use
the same accounts.

## Flatpak

The current manifest installs a pinned upstream binary release into `/app/bin`.
That makes the Flatpak self-contained and matches Parla's default resolver.

For Flathub or distro-grade reproducibility, the preferred long-term package is
to build `deltachat-rpc-server` from `chatmail/core` source as a separate module:

- Use `org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.rust-stable` or the Rust toolchain
  available in the chosen SDK.
- Pin the `chatmail/core` tag or commit.
- Generate and commit Cargo sources with `flatpak-cargo-generator`, or otherwise
  vendor dependencies so the Flatpak build does not need network access.
- Install only the final executable as `/app/bin/deltachat-rpc-server` or
  `/app/libexec/parla/deltachat-rpc-server`.

Avoid downloading executable updates at application runtime. Let Flatpak update
the bundled server together with Parla.

## Distro Packages

Distribution packages should either depend on a packaged
`deltachat-rpc-server` or ship the binary in a Parla-owned path:

- Preferred package dependency: `deltachat-rpc-server`.
- If the distro keeps helper executables out of `PATH`, install it as
  `/usr/libexec/parla/deltachat-rpc-server` or
  `/usr/lib/parla/deltachat-rpc-server`.
- Do not depend on Delta Chat Desktop just to obtain the JSON-RPC server.

Known packaged examples include Arch Linux `extra/deltachat-rpc-server` and the
FreeBSD `net/deltachat-rpc-server` port.
